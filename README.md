This shell script provides functionality for generating a random key, encrypting a file, and decrypting a file using OpenSSL. It presents a menu to the user, allowing them to choose between encryption, decryption, or generating a random key.

After each operation, it displays a success message indicating the outcome. If an invalid choice is made, it displays an error message.
